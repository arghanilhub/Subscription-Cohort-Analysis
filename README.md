## Subscription Monthly Cohort Analysis
### **Netflix** subscription records 
<br/> 
<h3>Project Background</h3> 
<hr> 
Recently Netflix is experiencing fluctuating subscriber growth, particularly as they expand globally and encounter new competitors in the streaming industry. To maintain its position and improve customer satisfaction, Netflix wants to understand patterns in user engagement, subscription duration, and churn. For that, I have been tasked to analyze the subscription records from  september 2022 to mid-september 2023 ( almost 1 year data ). By analyzing subscription data, I'm trying to answer these question :<br/> 
<br/> 

* **Retention and Churn Patterns:** Understanding how long customers stay subscribed, identifying which months have the highest or lowest churn rates, and determining whether our retention rate has surpassed the churn rate or not? 
* **Subscription Growth Insights:** Pinpointing key patterns in subscription increases, whether seasonal or tied to specific months, what percentage of customers have subscribed more than 5 months or more?

* **Customer Cohorts and Lifetime Value:** Identifying trends across cohorts (customers who joined within the same month or year), calculating the lifetime value of different customer groups( for both churned and active customers ) and forcasting how much additioanl revenue, the active customers can bring?  

This is a fictional Netflix subscription dataset that I obtained from Kaggle. I then prepared the data to fit the analysis I needed.<br/>    
In this project, I analyzed **retention and churn rates** in two ways. **First**, I examined how many customers stayed for more than five months versus those who left earlier. Based on this, I tracked whether retention has been higher or lower than the churn rate over time, and specifically if our retention rate has started surpassing churn in recent periods. In the **second approach**, I analyzed churn across the entire dataset to determine the average customer lifetime, which provides insights for forecasting additional revenue from our active customers.<br/>

<h3>Data Structure and Initial checks</h3> 
<hr> 
This is a single table dataset with the total records of 3069. Dataset includes information about 2800 subscribers from September 2022 through September 2023. Each record represents an indivitual customer's subscription, including the subscription cost, created/cancelled date, interval and the payment status.

So, more than 6 additional helper coloumns I have added in my preped dataset to fit the analysis I need.<br/>  
* To determine how many customers have stayed on our platform for more than 5 months versus less, I first calculated the **total months** each customer has spent. Then, from that list, I identified customers who spent **'>5 months'** and **'<5 months'**, placing them in separate columns. I used 5+ months as a baseline, considering any customer who exceeded this threshold as having good retention. The purpose of this analysis is to **compare retention and churn rates** for the given period, which indirectly reflects the platform's performance.<br/>

* Secondly, to determine the **total revenue/value** generated over the given period, I calculated **LTV** in two ways: first, for customers who didn’t stay for even a full month but still made a payment, and second, for those who stayed for more than a month. Putting both types in a single column I find challenging as I'm calculating revenue based on months spent, so I have to put in two separate columns and then I combined the revenue from both types into a single 'Total LTV' column. This calculated column not only provides an overall value but also shows the revenue generated by each cohort/month and its trend over time.

**Overview Findings**<br/> 

My analysis shows a steady growth in subscriptions from 2022 into 2023, with a marked boost after Q2 of 2023. Currently, 41% of our customers stay on the platform for more than five months, while 54% leave sooner. Encouragingly, since **June 2023**, our retention rate has started to surpass our churn rate, signaling improving customer loyalty. On average, each customer stays with us for around **seven months**. From September **2022** through November 3, **2024**, we’ve generated **over $800,000 in total revenue**, with active customers driving the majority of this. The **June, July, and August 2023 cohorts** stand out, not only for generating the highest revenue but also for having the most active customers and achieving the lowest churn rate.<br/> 

Below is the overview page from my excel report, which presents the top-line metrics along with how subscriptions have trended over time.<br/>

**Retention and Churn Patterns:**
<br/> 

* Our churn rate has typically been high, but starting in June 2023, **retention has surpassed churn** and continued on this positive trend. Additionally, **June, July, and August appear to have the highest subscription retention rates**. To understand the factors behind this improvement, we should investigate these months closely. **Did we implement any changes just after April?** If so, what kind of changes were they?<br/> 
* However, our **overall retention rate is still lower than our churn rate**, likely because the recent increase in retention is quite new. If this positive growth continues at the current pace, we can expect our overall retention percentage to eventually surpass the churn percentage.

<br/>

**Subscription Growth Insights:**
<br/>
* As our subscriber numbers continue to show a steady increase, **so does the average subscription duration**. Customers are maintaining their subscriptions for an average of **7 months**, and this duration is rising. Both metrics project a profitable business outlook, indicating that we’ve been implementing effective strategies since May 2023.

<br/> 

**Customer Cohorts and Lifetime Value:** 
<br/> 
* **Life time value** we generated during this period i.e from sept. 2022 upto 3rd nov. 2024 is  **$841,620**  from all the customer, including the churned as well as active ones. 
* We have total over **1055 Active customers** out of 2936 total customers, and generated **almost 700 thousand dollers**, which covers the big chunk of the total LTV amount we have generated from all of our customers. 
* It appears that users who subscribed in June, July, and August 2023 have generated the most revenue, and these months also have the highest number of active users.
* Based on our average churn rate which is 64% , if the active customers continue for **another 2 months** from the last day of recording , we could say that we can genearte an **additional amount of 80 thousand dollers**.[Revenue forcast from active custoemrs]

<br/> 
<br/> 

**Recommandations:** 
<br/> 
* We should **closely examine the months-June, July, and August of 2023**, as these cohorts generated the most revenue from both active and churned customers and also had the lowest churn rate. It’s essential to analyze these periods in depth—whether we introduced cost-effective subscription plans, implemented new marketing strategies, or added fresh content types to our platform. Understanding the factors behind these positive metrics can help us replicate successful strategies in upcoming months.<br/>
  
* To understand **why customers left our platform** and **what encouraged them to stay**, we need to **examine two time periods**: September 2022 to March 2023, when our churn rate was very high, and June 2023 to September 2023, when retention rates improved significantly. Analyzing these periods from a marketing or content strategy perspective will reveal what we lacked before and what changes we implemented afterward. These insights can guide our future strategies.
