## Subscription Monthly Cohort Analysis
### **Netflix** subscription records 
<br/> 
<h3>Project Background</h3> 
<hr> 
Recently Netflix is experiencing fluctuating subscriber growth, particularly as they expand globally and encounter new competitors in the streaming industry. To maintain its position and improve customer satisfaction, Netflix wants to understand patterns in user engagement, subscription duration, and churn. For that, I have been tasked to analyze the subscription records from  september 2022 to mid-september 2023 ( almost 1 year data ). By analyzing subscription data, I'm trying to answer these question :<br/> 
<br/> 

* **Retention and Churn Patterns:** Understanding how long customers stay subscribed, identifying which months have the highest or lowest churn rates, and determining whether our retention rate has surpassed the churn rate or not? 
* **Subscription Growth Insights:** Pinpointing key patterns in subscription increases, whether seasonal or tied to specific months, what percentage of customers have subscribed more than 5 months or more?

* **Customer Cohorts and Lifetime Value:** Identifying trends across cohorts (customers who joined within the same month or year), calculating the lifetime value of different customer groups( for both churned and active customers ) and forcasting how much additioanl revenue, the active customers can bring?  

This is a fictional Netflix subscription dataset that I obtained from Kaggle. I then prepared the data to fit the analysis I needed.<br/>    
In this project, I analyzed **retention and churn rates** in two ways. **First**, I examined how many customers stayed for more than five months versus those who left earlier. Based on this, I tracked whether retention has been higher or lower than the churn rate over time, and specifically if our retention rate has started surpassing churn in recent periods. In the **second approach**, I analyzed churn across the entire dataset to determine the average customer lifetime, which provides insights for forecasting additional revenue from our active customers.<br/>
